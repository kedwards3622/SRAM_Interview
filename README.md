To Run the application you must first have a Strava Account and access to the API Application sram_interview.

When running from Android Studio the user will have to go back to the application from the verification web page that opens. 

If the user is not in a club, then one will not show, otherwise the first club of the users will be displayed. 

Some future areas to improve:
1. The Spot above the athletes name will show a profile photo.
2. All clubs will show by usage of a recycler view around the card view.
